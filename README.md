## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an Arduino-based Note Detector project that uses sensors and logic to help distinguish real vs. fake Indian currency; blending basic electronics with software logic in a real-world application.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced coding skills (especially backend fundamentals, databases, and web development), deeper insights into computer hardware fundamentals, and practical software engineering workflows to build more reliable software systems.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Projects that combine software + hardware; anything from full-stack web apps to embedded systems prototypes to tools that solve everyday problems through simple yet impactful tech.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Guidance on best practices for building production-grade applications, and tips for expanding skills in databases, APIs, and scalable systems.
- 💬 Ask me about Basic computer hardware troubleshooting, Arduino prototyping, building websites, working with databases, and real-world problem solving using tech.
- 📫 How to reach me: Connect with me here on LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajveershinde/)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love approaching everyday problems with both electronics and code, whether it’s wiring sensors or crafting a responsive web page.
